<br />

A highly optimised, light-weight JS utility for [Ethereum](https://www.ethereum.org/) based on [`web3.js`](https://github.com/ethereum/web3.js), but lighter, async only and using `BN.js`.

Only **103 kB** minified!

## Install

```
npm install --save ethjs
```

## Usage

```js
const Eth = require('ethjs');
const eth = new Eth(new Eth.HttpProvider('https://ropsten.infura.io'));

eth.getBlockByNumber(45300, (err, block) => {
  // result null { ...block data... }
});

const etherValue = Eth.toWei(72, 'ether');

// result <BN ...>

const tokenABI = [{
  "constant": true,
  "inputs": [],
  "name": "totalSupply",
  "outputs":[{"name": "","type": "uint256"}],
  "payable": false,
  "type": "function",
}];

const token = eth.contract(tokenABI).at('0x6e0E0e02377Bc1d90E8a7c21f12BA385C2C35f78');

token.totalSupply().then((totalSupply) => {
  // result <BN ...>  4500000
});

token.transfer('0x...', 150).then((txHash) => {
  eth.getTransactionSuccess(txHash).then(txReceipt => {
    // result <Receipt { hash: '0x...', ... }>
  });
});
```

## Our Relationship with Ethereum & EthereumJS

We would like to mention that we are not in any way affiliated with the Ethereum Foundation. However, we love the work they do and work with them often to make Ethereum great! Our aim is to support the Ethereum ecosystem with a policy of diversity, modularity, simplicity, transparency, clarity, optimization and extensibility.

Many of our modules use code from `web3.js` and the `ethereumjs-` repositories. We thank the authors where we can in the relevant repositories.

## Special Thanks

`ethjs` was built by a strong community of Ethereum developers. A special thanks to:
